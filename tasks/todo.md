- [x] Create checklist for dashboard rewrite scope and verification before implementation.
- [x] Rewrite `app/artisan/(tabs)/index.tsx` to match required provider dashboard UX while preserving existing route behavior.
- [x] Rewrite `app/admin/(tabs)/index.tsx` to match required admin overview UX and keep route behavior intact.
- [x] Ensure `FadeInDown` covers all major sections in both dashboards and gradient cards use `expo-linear-gradient`.
- [x] Validate icon usage consistency (`Ionicons` + `MaterialCommunityIcons`) and handle data compatibility edge cases without modifying constants.
- [x] Verify `constants/role-dashboard-data.ts` is unchanged.
- [x] Verify non-dashboard artisan tabs remain untouched:
- [x] `app/artisan/(tabs)/services.tsx`
- [x] `app/artisan/(tabs)/wallet.tsx`
- [x] `app/artisan/(tabs)/jobs.tsx`
- [x] Run project lint/type checks and resolve any regressions.
- [x] Add review notes summarizing what was verified and outcomes.

## Review
- Rebuilt `app/artisan/(tabs)/index.tsx` with the requested provider dashboard sections, including per-card animated orange pulse indicators for pending bookings and safe upcoming-date parsing.
- Rebuilt `app/admin/(tabs)/index.tsx` with the requested overview layout, gradient stat cards, quick management grid, decision log, recent activity, and bookings snapshot.
- Verified only intended files changed: `app/artisan/(tabs)/index.tsx`, `app/admin/(tabs)/index.tsx`, and `tasks/todo.md`.
- Confirmed `constants/role-dashboard-data.ts` has no diff.
- Confirmed non-dashboard artisan tab files are unchanged.
- `npm run lint` passes.
- `npx tsc --noEmit` fails with many pre-existing repository-wide type errors outside these dashboard files.
